<br><h2>👋 Hi there I'm Víctor Vallejo</h2></br>
<br>I'm a spanish 🇪🇸 last year student of the 1st promotion of BEng Data Engineering & Systems at UPM. I have a strong academic background in Machine Learning, AI and mathematics. In addition, I have a huge passion for Investments and Quantitative Finance, and my professional goal is to apply my technical model in the quantitative trading/quantitative finance and banking field 📈📈.
